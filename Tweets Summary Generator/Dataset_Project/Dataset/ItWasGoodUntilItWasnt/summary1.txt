just happy Kehlani and JheneAiko finally jumped on a track together.
I love this one because it feels like classic Kehlani! I'm really smiling listening to this because I'm so happy for her
Kehlani really out here making me smile, cry, SING my heart out and feel all sexy with this new album 
It’s about to stay on REPEAT ItWasGoodUntilItWasnt 
The music HITS and the lyrics take the saying “in my feels to another dimension
