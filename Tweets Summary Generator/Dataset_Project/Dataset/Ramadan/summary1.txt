May you be illuminated this Ramadan and may the works of our scholars be a means to that end. 
Alhamdulilah for His mercy, provision, protection and strength. May we be part of those who will witness the end of this Ramadan and more to come. Amin.
May ALLAH remember us all a thousand fold today always. 
May Allah accept our fasting, our DUA'H, our good deeds in this holy month and count us among those who complete Ramadan
Let us not only develop our relationship with Allah, but also with ourselves and those around us. For those who are spending this time alone, may Allah give you strength and sabr. Ameen
Allah has sent the light of Ramadan to erase the night. He has sent the month of the Qur’an so that He might elevate us and bring us from our isolation to His nearness. May the almighty Allah grand us all jannah.
