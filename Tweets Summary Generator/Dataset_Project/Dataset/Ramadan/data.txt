Dozens of officers rushed to the scene where they have been gathering since the beginning of Ramadan about 8pm after colleagues were attacked, 5 arrested. https://t.co/8gWLnlzZxFRamadan should also be a time to reflect on ongoing injustices. Non-Black Muslim brothers and sisters, if you haven’t started to think critically about anti-Blackness within our communities, begin with supporting the work of @MuslimARC &amp;  @Margari_Aziza #IRunwithAhmaudProphet Muhammad (s.a.w) said..
