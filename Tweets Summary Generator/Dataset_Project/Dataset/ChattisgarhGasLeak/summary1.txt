8 people have been severely injured in Boiler Blast in a thermal power station in Neyveli.
2020 is becoming more and more bitter. Please someone undo this day at least
Three disasters VizagGasLeak,ChattisgarhGasLeak, and boilerblast in TN in a single day
My deepest condolences to the families. All this at a time when a big bunch companies wanted to shift operations from china to India
IS IT ALL COINCIDENCE OR A PLANNED ATTACK
Sending prayers to those who have been affected. Migrant Workers of Chattisgarh were walking from Maharashtra because two states can't start a train for these workers.
