Morning : VizagGasLeakage Afternoon : ChattisgarhGasLeak Evening :NeyveliThermalplantboilerblast 
My deepest condolences to the families of all the victims ChattisgarhGasLeak 

Three disasters VizagGasLeak, ChattisgarhGasLeak, and boilerblast in TN in a single day!

This year is getting worse by the day!

Please someone undo this day at least. Something wrong about this calendar year.

But what the hell, let's blame Narendermodi for everything
8 people have been severely injured in Boiler Blast in a thermal power station in Neyveli 2020 is becoming more and more bitter.
All this at a time when a big bunch companies wanted to shift operations from china to India IS IT ALL COINCIDENCE OR A PLANNED ATTACK Its high time to investigate
