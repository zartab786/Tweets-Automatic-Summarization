Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that causes one's body to have less hemoglobin than normal.
World Thalassemia Day is being observed today to raise awareness about this disorder while also caring for those suffering from it.
St Gurmeetramrahim guru ji says many benefits of donating blood. 
1)there is reduced risk of cancer. 
2) better heart health 
3) increased feel good factor 
4) iron levels get regulated. 
Regular blood donation camps are organized by DSS and there are world records in blood donation by this organization.
We also take this opportunity to thank our front line doctors/paramedics who are striving selflessly and tirelessly during this pandemic and saving lives.
Lakhs of lives have been saved by the DSS volunteers via regular blood donation.
