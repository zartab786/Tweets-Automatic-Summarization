Delhi Government has launched an e-token system (demo token in pic) for the sale of liquor in the national capital. 
This decision has been taken in view of crowding at liquor shops so that social distancing can be maintained.
the reopening of liquor shops in several states is becoming controversial.
If liquor shops can open in other states why not electronic shop in Bihar. 
Meanwhile in Mirzapur, liquor shop owners shower flower petals on customers queuing up outside their shops.
Modi government has opened liquor shops for tax revenue. We have all seen images of people pushing each other violating social distancing norms. If liquor stores can be opened, then why no ancillary medical services, repair workshops other self-employed services
Alcohol is considered bad things almost in every religion, but the irony is wine shops are fully crowded and Mosques, Temples and churches are closed for worshipers. Unfortunately, everything is upside down in my country, criminal is on bail and Scholar in jail
