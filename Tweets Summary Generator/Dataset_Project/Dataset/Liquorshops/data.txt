Sir liquor shops can be opened, shramik special trains can be run, ppl stranded abroad can be brought back, then pls start domestic flights and trains also, of course with limited number of passengers.

#resumedomesticflights@TimesNow They had no brains to do it before opening liquor shops. What a governance.
Helping spread of corona sequence after mass exit of labour class from Delhi, Markaz episode......@KTRTRS @KTRoffice @cyberabadpolice my opinion is it's very big mistake of opening liquor shops after 48 days strict lockdown,few videos are getting viral on social media on this,by seeing it no one following social distance and wearing masks unlike happening at essential stores@HardeepSPuri Liquor shops gathering don't spread Corona. But Domestic flights with screening and precautions will. Or is it just that, India wants it's Economy to go back by a couple of decade.

See the numbers of positive cases in last 5 days.
