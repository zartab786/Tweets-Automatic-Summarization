Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx Used Imperial College Model -- NOW CONFIRMED AS A COMPLETE FRAUD -- To Persuade President Trump to Lock Down Entire US Economy

Keep practising Social_Distancing
Infection rates are still rising I am going out of my fucking mind at the thought of the lock down being eased when every day there are still thousands of new cases, we are the worst hit in Europe 
Financial capital Mumbai will be under lock down for atleast next 2 months. He wasted 50 days of lock down, cases rising everyday
Irrespective of what this government says I'll be maintaining my "lock down" because I know, I just know that this is going to kick start cases, the spread and I just don't trust that this is the right time.
