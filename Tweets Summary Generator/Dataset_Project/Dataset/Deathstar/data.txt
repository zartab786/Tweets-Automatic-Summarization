Overall Rogue One:
Love this movie, amazing scenery.

Their excuses get more pathetic by the day.@FettWalkerA33 @MoJus23 @K_yrlya @DougFairchild Luke blew up the Death Star in his first time piloting an xwingIf Tara Reade is the Death Star that the Trump campaign is counting on, then count the Trump campaign as finished.@MysterySolvent A tactic of the Parscale MAGAt Death Star is to get large accounts whacked whenever possible.
