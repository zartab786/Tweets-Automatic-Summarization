Overall Rogue One:
Love this movie, amazing scenery.
Stardust, it’s connection to the Death Star.

I am one with the force and the force is with me. Not happy, but perfect endings for characters. 
Darth Vader against the Rebels in corridor, Maybe they can use Space Force to save the Death Star
The ending was bittersweet. the Death Star was destroyed by the Resistance
Death Star that the Trump campaign is counting on, then count the Trump campaign as finished.
Donald Trump's day so far:

- Justin Department drops Michael Flynn case
- Van Grack withdraws from case
- This may not go the way Bill Barr is hoping
- Trump campaign compares itself to Death Star
- That's not how the force works!
- Trump is going to prison
